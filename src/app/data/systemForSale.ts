System Overview
This secure quiz-taking system is designed to prevent cheating and enhance overall quiz management. One of its key features is the anti-cheating mechanism: students are not allowed to switch tabs during a quiz. If a student attempts to Alt+Tab or navigate away from the quiz window, the system will automatically submit their quiz and flag it with a cheating status. This status is visible to the teacher for transparency and accountability.

For Teachers
Teachers have full control over quiz creation and management. They can create quizzes with customizable time limits, deadlines, and subject tags. After students complete the quizzes, teachers can view all student scores and track their performance. To make evaluation easier, the system includes filtering options that help teachers sort and analyze student data efficiently.

For Students
Students can access and view all quizzes assigned to them by their teachers. Each quiz comes with a clear time limit and must be completed within the specified window. Once completed, students can review their quiz history, including past scores and performance metrics, allowing them to monitor their progress over time.
